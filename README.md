# GOVAN IS BACK
And more Discord than ever. This is just an administrative/silly fun bot for my private server.

## Functionality
### No context
One in 100 messages that are less than 261 characters are put in the #no-context channel. You'll also get a randomized role!

### Hall of fame
If any one message gets 3 📌 reactions from people who are not the author, it enters the hall of fame for posterity. 

### The twitterverse
Reacting with 🔁 or 🔂 on a message sends it to the Infinitely Tall Cylinder Earth version of twitter and returns a picture of your message as a tweet there.
🔂 only takes your text, and 🔁 also takes other people's messages as extra tweets below yours.

## Commands
### !pin {message}
Puts a message in the hall of fame. But it'll be marked. Cheaters beware, democracy is strong.

### !color {hex}
Changes your role color if any of your roles have a color. Because I can't be arsed with administration

### !role
Gives out the number and the name of the current randomized role. Collect them all!

### !roll [sides]
Rolls a D[sides] or a D20 if no sides are given. Warning: Highly addictive

### !puzzle
Hmmmm...

## FAQ

### Why did you make this?
This is the spiritual successor to my Steam bot Sir Govan. Just for fun and no profit.

### Can you add <IDEA>?
If I like it and you're not rude, maybe.

### Why is there no !help?
It's not needed. If you want help, just scroll up.

### I hate this
That's not a question.

### I hate this?
The fact I've made this joke in every FAQ, or this bot?
